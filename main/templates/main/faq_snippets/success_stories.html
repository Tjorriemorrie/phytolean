            After having my three children I neglected my weight. My divorce was my wake-up call to get back to the real me and get back into shape. As I am experiencing Menopause, I found it very difficult to shed the pounds even after very disciplined attempts to lose weight on my own. I joined the specialized weight loss program at my coach's recommendation. I knew my hormones were playing a factor as I have been diagnosed with hypothyroidism. My coach explained very meticulously that my condition required a different approach and could take a little longer. I was pleasantly surprised that I lost 0.6kg in my first month despite of no exercise! I did reach a plateau but persisted and saw a steady weight loss after that. I also realized that I was also holding onto a lot of negative emotion along with the weight after my divorce. After becoming mindful and addressing these causes the speed of weight loss increased dramatically. I am now a size 32 and used to be a 16<br/> -Lydia

            “When I started off on my weight loss journey, I was typing into my Google search bar “weight loss consultant near me”. It was important for me to find some-one that could help me as I have tried quite a lot of things, read all the fad books, tried the fat burners, watched videos online, googled recipes like an OCD hobby but still I was feeling tired, miserable and like a failure. I needed to lose weight fast, but despite my nutritionist background I was not seeing the results in my own life. I felt like a fraud! I knew all the things my textbook said, but for some mysterious reason I was on the brink of diabetes, my skin was not clear, I felt tired, bloated, lethargic and sick. Most of all, I was sick and tired of dieting and trying everything under the sun. The mental load of defeat had chipped away at my determination as well as my self-confidence to achieve my weight loss goals. Through a friend I learned about a program that promised to burn belly fat allowing you to slim down and lose weight without exercise. It sounded too good to be true, even preposterous. But I had to admit slimming down and becoming lean without trying to starve myself or kill myself at the gym in all honesty appealed to me. I went into the experience expecting just another weight loss diet counting the peas on your plate and numbing the mind while counting calories. I was pleasantly surprised to learn this approach did not involve endless meal plans I could not stick to, nor did it involve a diet plan for weight loss! Also no calorie counting!! I unknowingly stumbled across the best way to lose weight! You could imagine my surprise, that this program made use of fat burning foods as the fastest way to lose weight. Foods that regulate your metabolism, improve your health while never feeling starved or lightheaded.  To be honest, certain foods I used to binge on were now off limits, but I did not mind the weight loss foods. After two weeks of sticking to the program I saw the first changes and my skin cleared up! My taste buds adjusted and my food preferences changed, just like the coach said it would! I needed less sleep and I felt strangely less toxic.  I hate exercise due to an old knee and ligament injury. That combined with excess weight made exercise well, a painful exercise so to speak. I was delighted to see a steady weight loss occurring and I was sold. I no longer have issues with my high blood pressure and have reduced my insulin resistance medication working with my physician. I have been on this program for 6 years now and even though I don’t need to see my coach anymore, I like to touch base and let her know how I am doing monthly with an online session. We addressed emotional issues linked to eating now that pops up for me on certain occasions. Especially during social events where it’s expected to eat certain foods or have drinks. It's then that I schedule a weight maintenance follow up session that is dirt cheap. I will continue with this program because when I see my weight increasing after an exam, holiday or stressful time at work, I can call my coach and she gets me right on track. I am the type of person that needs this type of motivation. Thank you for the life changing results guys!” <br/> -Bridget

            As a 70 old year male I joined the program with my main focus to lose the centimetres around my waist. Strangely enough my other symptoms started to ease too. My digestive issues improved and my Diverticulosis symptoms disappeared! I completed blood work for a health check up with my GP and he kept asking what I was doing as my cholesterol and blood pressure was normal and very impressive for my age. I explained to him what I was doing and he was taking notes! I would suggest this program as a health investment for anyone over the age of 65years. My wife has since adopted this regimen too and has seen improvements with Lupus.  Two of our children and our grandchildren have also embraced it for the health benefits.

            I wanted to shed the weight after my pregnancy but seemed to be unable to do so. I also suffered from postpartum depression that made me very emotional and I felt defeated. As a new mom I also did not have the time I used to have to invest in myself and my own wellbeing. I struggled therefore with motivation, commitment and needed a weight loss coach to help me through the process to regain my prior weight. I was pleasantly surprised that our sessions supported my mental wellbeing the way it did. I started talking about my relationship with food, my prior trauma and how that related to my eating disorder as a young girl. I struggled with a lot of guilt because I wanted to give my baby the best nutrition while slimming down at the same time. Joining the PhytoLean program was the best investment I made for myself. Even though it took time I eventually regained my pre-pregnancy weight while providing good nutrition for my nursing baby.  It has made a world of difference in how I feel about myself. It has also helped me to understand things in my past and how to better cope with my emotional load. The support of my coach has been invaluable. I would recommend this program to anyone.<br/>-Elsabe

            Despite cutting out junk food, living a more active lifestyle and not overeating, by 2011 my weight had increased to 108kg. In three months, I lost 10kg. Despite my efforts to diet and exercise my diabetic markers was getting worse. I became desperate after developing cataracts and joined. Since starting the program I have now lost a further 17kg without needing a ridiculously restrictive diet or exercise program, and it has changed the way I approach food for good. I have reversed my diabetes with blood parameter than have remained normal for 3 years. There have been some ‘side effects,’ I sleep better than I have ever slept, feel more energetic than I did 15 years ago and I have not had my recurrent episodes of back pain twice a year. Even more amazingly, two thick patches of ugly lichen planus around my ankles, which I had from the age of 10, have completely vanished and my nocturnal acid reflux has not recurred in 3 years! My total cholesterol level is 3.8mmol/l year on year and all my other lipid parameters are normal. Above all, I feel full after I eat, rather than constantly hungry when I was trying to diet.<br/>- Rajiv

            What a journey! All I can say is that I have experienced this program as very different from what I have tried in the past. But again, I always gained the weight back in my prior attempts. I have been on the program for three months so far and I have seen the improvements in my lifestyle, mentality, food choices and spirituality. The weight loss is actually now a bonus! Thank God for the work you are doing and may he continue to bless everyone with health participating in your program.<br/> -Alice

            I used the Phytolean program to lose weight before my honeymoon. I was able to wear my bikini on the Beach of Mauritius.<br/>-Susan

            From being 76kg at 40 years old, I am now 62kg, losing the in weight with very little effort. I no longer have high blood pressure or cholesterol, confirmed at all my subsequent check-ups with my GP. I am sure this would not be the case had I not followed this way of eating. I must add, I’m still trying to convince my mum, dad, brother and friends to do the same. <br/>-Robert
