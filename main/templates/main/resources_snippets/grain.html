                        <h2>The Three Grain Super Cereal</h2>
                        <p>The three grain cereal is a quick, easy, very nutritious and digestible
                            breakfast.  This super porridge is stacked with fiber, with a low
                            glycemic index for sustained energy release and the fortified grains
                            are also high in iron.  Added nuts provide more protein and omega 3
                            (good) oils.  Also see the healing breakfast for more information about
                            what a healthy breakfast involves.</p>

                            <p>The following items are required for this 3 grain cereal preparation:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A pot</li>
                                <li>A cup</li>
                                <li>A spoon</li>
                                <li>Three grains you have chosen from the list above</li>
                                <li>A hotbox (this is optional)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>When using the hotbox option approximately 10 minutes will be required for preparation time
                                the night before. The next morning the cereal will be soft, hot and well-cooked. It is
                                simply the easiest way to prepare a super nutritious cereal in the least amount of time.</p>
                            <p>If you do not have a professionally made hot box three zip-up cooler bags (those used to keep
                                frozen food cold) can be used. Place one freezer bag inside the other and a plate on the
                                base of the inner bag.</p>
                            <p>Alternatively wrap a large blanket (folded in four) over the pot to
                                seal in the heat. After placing the warm pot inside the bags remember to zip up each
                                individual zip-up bag.  The hot box can be left until the next morning.</p>

                            <h3>Method</h3>
                            <p>If you want to enjoy your super nutritious three grain cereal in the morning preparations will be required the night before.</p>
                            <p><strong>When using hard grains (example Sorghum, Barley or wheat) or hard and soft grains
                                together</strong> it is very important that the grains are well cooked before consumption.
                                Those suffering from digestive difficulties will greatly benefit from soaking the grains
                                overnight before cooking them.</p>
                            <p>The following preparation method can be followed the night before:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Boil the kettle.</li>
                                <li>Switch the stove plate on.</li>
                                <li>Place grains with correct amounts of boiling water in to a pot
                                    with a lid.</li>
                                <li>Add a pinch of salt, vanilla or cinnamon. </li>
                                <li>Dates, chopped raisins or dried fruit can be added to taste
                                    (Optional to sweeten porridge with good sugars ).</li>
                                <li>Add a teaspoon of coconut oil. </li>
                                <li>Bring contents to a boil, stir, put lid back on and bring to a
                                    boil again. DONâ€™T LIFT THE LID.</li>
                                <li>If using a hotbox; lift pot off stove and tuck into box, a slow
                                    cooker or a homemade hot box from zipper bags or a blanket. Let
                                    it stand for the night. When using a homemade hot box; tuck towel
                                    around the pot and the zip-up bags, tying the handles on the
                                    outside of the bag together. Do not lift the lid at this stage as
                                    it will allow the heat to escape. </li>
                                <li>If not using a hotbox; Bring contents to a boil, stir, and place
                                    lid back on again. Leave to simmer for 10 minutes until the center
                                    of the pot contents are boiling vigorously. Lower heat and continue
                                    to stir occasionally until all grains are soft and
                                    well cooked. </li>
                                <li>The porridge can be placed in the fridge or freezer and reheated
                                    when required.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>For those using the hotbox option the cereal will be warm cooked and ready to dish up
                                the next morning. No re-heating required! Also the pot is easy to clean. This porridge
                                is super nutritious and bursting with energy but takes less time to prepare the next
                                morning than most box cereals.</p>

                                tablespoons over your porridge. Alternatively for an even better combination of amino
                                acids and fats; Grind 1 cup of linseed, â…“ cup of sunflower seeds, â…“ cup of sesame seeds,
                                and â…“ cup of pumkin seeds together in coffee grinder. Mix the seed powder together and
                                have 2 tablespoons of this mixed seed mix over your 3 grain porriage.  Enjoy with
                                bannana , honey,  sweet molasses and a non dairy milk like soy, rice milk, almond or
