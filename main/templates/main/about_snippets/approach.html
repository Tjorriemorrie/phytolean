        <h3>What makes our approach unique and different from anything out there?</h3>
        <p>Dieting just doesn’t work.</p>
        <p>According to the New York Times, 95% of people who lose weight on a diet gain it back, and a significant percentage of people gain back more than they had originally lost, just like in less than a year or two almost everyone who wins the lottery is worse off than before they won it!</p>
        <p>For this reason, we do not offer you a quick fix diet, medication, invasive procedures or surgery,  or some magical shortcut like photoshop to look and feel great.</p>
        <p>Our approach does not involve fad diets that get results quick but you regain your weight and then some more.</p>
        <p>Lose the weight and keep it off</p>
        <p>We do offer a natural holistic and integrative lifestyle approach to slimming and weight loss. Our approach is backed by evidence based science and involves a change in lifestyle, with a focus on quality of nutrition, mindset and healthy eating habits to promote wellness in all areas of life. Medically proven and supported by Evidence based research our approach to weight loss is proudly one of the top four programs in the world to consider currently for weight loss.</p>
        <p>We promote a mild, gentle yet effective and gradual weight loss solution over time.  Our objective involves losing weight and keeping it off without regaining or doubling the weight once lost.</p>
        <p>We also work on your mindset, your body love, your will, mindful eating habits, addressing emotional eating, your decision-making processes and empower you with the knowledge to make good lifestyle and food choices for your body, mind and soul.</p>
        <p>Without approaching you as a unique and complex being on all dimensions of your existence, lasting results would be fleeting. The results simply will not stick!</p>
        <p>Eating better, not less</p>
        <p>What makes our approach effective and unique is that it does not require calorie counting but allows one to eat to satiation (until satisfied). You won’t go around feeling starved or deprived. Our focus is on eating better, not less.</p>
        <p>We empower you to understand your own unique body and its challenges, and how other factors like lifestyle, hormones, eating habits, stress and even the water you choose to drink can contribute to making you fat!</p>
        <p>With us there is no fat shaming or guilting. We understand the struggle is real! Our consultants have faced many of the struggles and challenges you have faced and still might be facing now. We are here to help support and guide you drawing from our own experiences and expertise towards the goals you want to achieve. We recognize how important motivation, the right mindset, and commitment is for obtaining the results you desire throughout this journey.</p>
        <p>Our weight loss consultants and accountability coaches have walked the talk and have obtained these astounding and lasting results in their own weight loss journeys. We are thrilled to share what has worked for us in our own lives to lose weight and keep it off.</p>
        <p>Remember if you are in need of medical assistance, advice or care; do not hesitate to seek out assistance when needed. We encourage working with general practitioners, specialists, nutritionists, physical therapists or any other health professional that can best support your health needs as a team.  Afterall, your wellbeing and optimal care is of uttermost importance to us.</p>
        <p>We all have foods we absolutely love. During this programme learn how and when to cheat guilt free and still stay slim. We deal with cravings in a positive way by understanding why certain foods are being craved. This is usually due to unidentified deficiencies. Gaining insight into possible deficiencies and providing foods rich in these needed nutrients will start to naturally decrease these cravings. We understand slow transition and re-education is key. Making small changes and building on your successes.  For this reason, we provide suggestions for healthy substitutes to these cravings with much of the taste but more of the natural goodness your body needs to function at its best.</p>
        <p>We do not burden you with required meal plans, shopping lists or schedules but provide insight on what your personalized ideal plate should look like. You are empowered to create what’s on your plate! We talk about good eating habits, sharing yummy recipes and meal ideas that you prefer and food aligned with taste preferences and any food sensitivities or allergies you might experience.</p>
        <p>We educate you on the food culprits that might be depleting your energy levels, slowing your digestion and metabolism and adding the centimeters. These bad boys might even be interfering with your moods, hormonal levels and quality of sleep.</p>
        <p>Exercise is not mandated or required</p>
        <p>Exercise is not mandated or required to partake in this program but recommended for those who can participate. As our approach to weight loss does not mandate exercise it is ideal for those morbidly obese, those suffering from mobility restrictions, injuries, past surgeries or chronic pain hampering strenuous exercise or anyone that is looking for a gentler way to weight loss.</p>
        <p>Support and community</p>
        <p>We feel strongly about group support and community. Our online weight loss and wellness workshops provide support groups where you can share your weight loss journey, ask questions and get recommendations on challenges experienced. Our nutritional advisors, coaches and facilitators will also be with you every step of the way.</p>
        <p>The Psychology of eating</p>
        <p>We explore your relationship with food, the psychology of eating and consider factors that can contribute to comfort eating, over eating, under eating or eating disorders. We hold the space to mindfully consider why certain experiences, circumstances and emotions you have experienced in life could be holding you back from losing the dead weight you no longer desire.</p>
