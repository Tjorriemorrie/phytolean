                <p class="text-justify">As Hippocrates the father of modern medicine said, “Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.” Though this statement is controversial, its essence rings true today — eat foods that nourish you both physically and mentally from the inside out. We have over 30 trillion cells in our bodies! These cells continuously die off and need to be replaced by manufactured new cells. Within the next year, 95% of the cells in your body will die and be replaced. Even though some cells and systems take longer, in just 365 days most of your body would have rebuilt itself into something better (or worse), depending on how well you treat it. You guessed right, these new cells are built out of what you consume. For example; the skin is replaced every 30 days. That means what you consume is used to renew and rebuild your skin and changes can be seen in the elasticity and skin appearance after just 30 days! The good news is here at PhytoLean we can renew the skin and fight the effects of aging through nourishing foods and phytochemicals that beautify and rejuvenate the skin in as little as a month.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">The foods we eat truly are the building blocks to our body. Like building material, if you use superior quality products you are laying a good foundation for the structural integrity of cells, organs and body systems. If you use inferior quality foods, yet cheap and convenient; the chance is you are going to pay for it sooner or later when your health crumbles. Just like the foundation of a building structure that was built with inferior quality goods. Good nutrition is at the foundation of our health and wellbeing. In essence the saying “you are what you eat” has never been truer. There is no way to sugar coat it. If you eat crap,  you will feel crap. You will also function like crap.  Just like your car, your body performance is directly linked to what fuel you are placing into your body tank in the form of food. Your mental clarity, your stress levels, your gut functioning, your emotional health, your headaches, the aches in your joints, your skin breakouts, your sleeping patterns, the diseases you are experiencing, your weight and even your fertility is related to what you chose to place into your body to become YOU. Although you might have been unaware that these things are all inter-related, your nutrition reaches every inch of your body, literally. And the good news is when we approach the body from an integrative and functional nutrition point of view/approach you are able to address the body as a whole. This is what is meant with a Holistic approach. We look at all aspects of WHO you are, affecting your life, identify areas of needed support and work out a personalized programme to support you to become the best possible version of who you can be. How is this done, you might wonder? Through a Total transformation giving your body high quality building blocks spoon after spoon. After a year of good nutrition and quality nourishment you would have rebuilt a new you! Most cells, organs and systems will have been replaced with new ones using superior building material! You have literally built and transformed your body into a completely new you! Are you up for a total transformation?</p>

                <p class="text-justify">For this reason, our program runs over the course of a year. You can join anytime, and cancel anytime at the end of the month if you chose to do so. But to obtain the real lasting results most are after and to rebuild a completely new you, takes time. To be exact the science shows a minimum of a year. During this time rebuilding new habits, thought patterns, mindsets, incorporating lifestyle changes, one small step at a time also requires time. As change takes time. And we all know that change is hard, and not something that happens overnight. Come to think of it; a year is not long if you consider how long it took to get to this point in your life with your current weight and health status.</p>
