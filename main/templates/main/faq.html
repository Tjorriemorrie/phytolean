                <dl>
                    <dt>Can I have the free initial consultation online?</dt>
                    <dd>Yes, you are more than welcome to schedule a free no obligation session online. If you prefer to meet in person or are in the local area of Hartebeespoortdam you can arrange to have a face to face, one on one session if that is preferred. Whatever works best and is most convenient.</dd>

                    <dt>Will I have regular coaching sessions when I join the program?</dt>
                    <dd>Yes, we provide personal weight loss coaching sessions weekly, scheduled online for convenience or in person.</dd>

                    <dt>How long will the program last?</dt>
                    <dd>This depends on the amount of weight that you need to lose, the support that you will be requiring and the length of time needed to complete the different stages of the programme. That is why our free consultation sessions are so valuable as you will understand the best programme for your individual needs. Time after time those who have done our programmes said it was excellent value!</dd>

                    <dt>What results can be expected?</dt>
                    <dd>Everyone is unique in their weight loss journey but studies have shown that adherence to the program can lead to a weight loss average of 1.5 pounds to 5 pounds (0.6- 2.2 kg) per week without strenuous exercise. Some have seen up to 14 pounds (6.3kg) a week but slow and gradual weight loss is encouraged during our program as losing weight too fast has its own complications and health implications. We also believe in steady sustainable weight loss and we do not chase results at the cost of your health and mental wellbeing.  Underlying hormonal and metabolic factors might influence results and will have to be addressed for optimal weight loss results and benefits. For this reason results may vary.</dd>

                    <dt>Will it be easy to maintain my weight?</dt>
                    <dd>The last stage of the programme deals with weight maintenance, providing simple guidelines and tools helping you to maintain your weight. Ongoing support is available as needed for your weight maintenance at discounted rates. This is our way of showing our dedication to your commitment.</dd>

                    <dt>Is there a discounted rate available for weight maintenance sessions after reaching my ideal weight?</dt>
                    <dd>Yes, we are committed to reward you for your commitment and perseverance by providing ongoing support through sessions charged at a fraction of the cost.</dd>

                    <dt>What if I fall back into my old ways of eating while on the program?</dt>
                    <dd>Do not be discouraged, we are with you every step of the way to encourage, motivate and support you. Any setbacks will bring insight about your eating habits and what other emotional factors might be at play that need to be addressed. As these factors surface, we will tackle them together. So, setbacks might be seen as part of the process for some, and that is normal. We are going to work with your setbacks and triumphs moving you towards your weight loss goals. You will be back on track in no time. All we need is your commitment and trust in the process.</dd>

                    <dt>Will this programme be hard to follow?</dt>
                    <dd>What makes this programme unique is that we follow a client- centered coaching process where you are in charge of the changes we implement. We identify your goals and implement small changes that you are a 100% confident you can manage and do. This means you will never feel overwhelmed or that our programme is too hard for you. Read more here about our programme and how we set you up for success.</dd>

                    <dt>When can I join or cancel?</dt>
                    <dd>The course of the program runs over a year. Read here more about why. You can join the programme anytime  and cancel by giving us notice at the end of the month.</dd>

                    <dt>What is the name of the diet plan your programme follows?</dt>
                    <dd>We do not use a diet plan. The average person will try 126 different diets in their lifetime. Often times these “crash diets” promise quick weight loss which is difficult, if not impossible to maintain. Granted these results can be exciting, but it causes an emotionally painful cycle of losing and regaining the weight over and over again.  We believe that an individualized personalized weight loss solution taking into consideration your unique profile, your weight loss goals and health needs is the reason why we have been so successful as a weight loss consultancy. We believe that your program and your habit change should be unique to YOU. You deserve better than the cookie-cutter weight loss programs out there! Everyone is different metabolically, psychologically and circumstantially. Because of this there isn’t a single diet plan that works well for everyone. We customize healthy habits, lifestyle and nutrition specifically to your body, your needs and your goals.</dd>

                    <dt>Are supplements or products compulsory as part of the programme?</dt>
                    <dd>Not at all! Our results are achieved by behaviour, change, nutrition and lifestyle intervention modification. If certain deficiencies are identified we encourage the use of supplements and products to support your health and well-being. Use of products or supplements are not mandatory to follow our programme and are optional. Like always, you are in full control and in the driver seat of the process.</dd>

                    <dt>What are the costs?</dt>
                    <dd>Everyone is unique and therefore has different weight loss challenges and goals. For this reason we have different programmes to cater for different individual needs. As each of our programmes are tailor-made for you, depending on where you are at in your weight-loss journey, it is best to book a free non-obligatory discovery session to determine which programme is best suited for your needs. Your consultant will accordingly advise you on the financial investment for your programme.</dd>

                    <dt>Will your programme accommodate special food requirements, allergies and food sensitivities?</dt>
                    <dd>Yes! Our programme is especially designed to accommodate special food requirements, cultural considerations and individual preferences.</dd>
