                <h2>The best way to lose weight with support, self-care and figure pampering over lunchtime.</h2>
                <h4>Change with support</h4>
                <br/>
                <p>Here at PhytoLean we value natural, gentle yet effective approaches to weight loss. We value powerful, whole, natural foods. We are doing things differently, and therein lies the reason for our success. It has been demonstrated that those who work with accountability partners and coaches lose three times more weight than people trying to diet on their own! For this reason our personal consultants play a huge part in our members' weight loss journeys and their successes. Our aim is optimal body balance of all your systems, organs, metabolism, mindset, hormone levels as well as your weight.</p>
                <p>We help busy working moms invest in themselves and reclaim their beauty, health and confidence with self-care and figure pampering.</p>
                <p>We recognize all the best diet and lifestyle advice in the world is meaningless if the programme does not support behavioural modification leading to the change in your life that you desperately crave. Our programme incorporates psychological principles from the transtheoretical or stages of change model to support you in your transformation process. We do not simply offer advice, meal plans or shopping lists. We offer a comprehensive support programme for change. We know change is messy and involves setbacks and relapses. We recognize that as part of the process. Failure is feedback. Setbacks are opportunities.   And we will never ever guilt or shame you for that and neither should you. All we ask is for your commitment and dedication to learn from setbacks, take valuable insights from them (like why the set back occurred and what can be done in the future to prevent it) and keep moving forward!</p>
                <p>Our skilled coaches compassion, expertise and support are key factors in the PhytoLean programs unique approach to weight loss success. With a dedicated and knowledgeable online or in-person weight loss coach by your side, someone will always be there for you on the good days to celebrate your successes and on the hard days to support and motivate you to stay on track. Clients using our weight loss program approach (over 100,000 clients to date) have had massive successes in losing weight permanently by incorporating nutrition, exercise, and mindset coaching into their lives.</p>
                <p>We believe that an individualized personalized weight loss solution taking in consideration your unique profile, your weight loss goals and health needs is the reason why we have been so successful as a weight loss consultancy. We believe that your program and your habit change should be unique to YOU. You deserve better than the cookie-cutter weight loss programs out there! Everyone is different metabolically, psychologically and circumstantially. Because of this there isn’t a single diet plan that works well for everyone. We customize healthy habits, lifestyle and nutrition specifically to your body, your needs and your goals. Sometimes it’s not always feasible to meet with a consultant in person. This could be due to Covid restrictions, location or a busy schedule. That’s where Phytoleans’s online consulting and supplement/product delivery service comes in. We are dedicated to make your weight loss experience as convenient, flexible yet supportive as possible! So speak to us regarding your specific needs.</p>

                <p>So many women have spent years or decades caring for others, losing touch with their own bodies and needs in the process. Our generation have supported the idea that a big part of our purpose as women is to care for other people, even at the expense of our own health. This sacrifice seems noble at first glance but women are starting to understand that self-care isn’t selfish. And besides, when we take the time to prioritize our own wellbeing, we are more effective at taking care of others anyway.  We are committed to make it easy for busy working women to squeeze in some time to pamper themselves, investing in themselves with selfcare over lunchtime. What better time to discuss how you can fight acne with food, regain your figure, slow aging or save time preparing healthy tasty meals than over lunchtime?</p>
                <p>Our Nationwide lunchtime online consulting initiative give busy women the option to schedule a weight loss session online during their lunch break in the comfort of their home or office without leaving the office! Any products or orders can be conveniently delivered to your door according to your needs. We are also assisting clients globally in slimming down! And we have helped clients worldwide (in over 16 countries) online to lose weight, gain confidence and reclaim the healthy, active lifestyles they want to live. As these sessions are 100% online, private and confidential, you can live ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD and still lose weight with our support and motivation. You have the flexibility to complete your lifestyle changes and nutrition habits when you have time, on your own schedule.</p>
                <p>Not only will your online weight loss coach help you with your food and lifestyle planning during weight loss, but they can also help with your weight maintenance goals after you've lost the weight through our maintenance program. We also believe in continued support to maintain your ideal weight so we offer special discounted rates for online weight maintenance sessions to demonstrate our commitment to honour your dedication.</p>
                <p>Busy yet ready to invest in yourself as a woman and practice self-care and figure pampering though delicious nourishing foods?</p>
